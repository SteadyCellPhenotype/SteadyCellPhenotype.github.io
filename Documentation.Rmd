# Ternary Networks

A ternary network is a pair $\mathcal{T}=(G, F)$, where $G$ is a digraph on $n$ nodes and $F = (f_1, \dots, f_n): \{0,1,2\}^n \to \{0,1,2\}^n$ is a global transition function. Each node $v$ in $G$ takes on the values in the set $\{0,1,2\}$ and is updated by a local activation function $f_v:\{0,1,2\}^n \to \{0,1,2\}$. The value of the function $f_v$ depends on its input nodes and their current state. The update schedule is *synchronous* meaning that all nodes in the network are updated simultaneously.


## Example

To make terminology precise and clear we will use one of our previously published models of intracellular iron metabolism https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005352. Here we only will use portion of the network termed *Iron Homeostasis Pathway* in the article (Hepcidin is excluded), which results in the network on six nodes. See image below.
