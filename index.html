      <h1>Ternary networks: a brief introduction</h1>

      <p>
        Ternary models can represent biomolecular networks in a simple and intuitive manner by
        viewing the network in terms of a collection of logical rules. One can think of these models
        as an extension of Boolean models if simple logic is employed, but ternary models can also
        utilize more complicated rules and expressions. Each species in ternary network is
        represented by three states: 0, 1, and 2. Various assignments have been suggested for the
        states. For example, one possibility is to view 0 as
        <i>false/inactive</i>, 2 as <i>true/active</i>, and 1 as <i>unknown</i>, meaning that 1
        can be either true/active or false/inactive. Another possibility is to think of these
        numbers as concentration levels of various proteins: <i>low</i> (0),
        <i>normal</i> (1) and <i>high</i> (2). Regardless of the labeling the interactions in the
        network can be translated into functions over the finite field on three elements and then
        used to perform simulations and to compute the entire state space. <!-- The state space is
        Z_3^N, what is there to compute?
                                                                           
                                            you can adjust my wording after i finish this intro ... -->
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Formally, a ternary network is a pair \(\mathcal{T}=(G, F)\), where \(G\) is a
        digraph <!-- It doesn't look like we use the digraph structure susbsequently. I understand
        that it's used as a heuristic, but should it be part of the definition?  How about defining
        a ternary network and then one suboridinate to a graph?
                
                This page is is an intro to ternary models in general and I think we should be a bit more precise.
                I though we wanted to have some general information about these models. Even if the app does
                not use digraphs they are part of the model building. Uninformed users should have somewhat
                detailed introduction to that... let me know now if you think that all of this in unnecessary so that
                I do not waist my time typing details. Make sure to outline for me what exactly you think should
                go into documentations.  -->
        
        on \(n\) nodes and \[F = (f_1,
        \dots, f_n): \{0,1,2\}^n \to \{0,1,2\}^n\] is a global transition function. Each node \(v\)
        in \(G\) takes on the values in the set \(\{0,1,2\}\) and is updated by a local activation
        function \(f_v:\{0,1,2\}^n \to \{0,1,2\}\). The value of the function \(f_v\) depends on its
        input nodes and their current state.

        Figure 1 below depicts a graph \(G\) on six species. This network is part of our previously
        published much larger network (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005352">
        https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005352</a>). We have selected the <i>iron homeostasis
        pathway</i> to demonstrate the ideas and the terminology of this section. The underlying
        graph is directed graph in the sense that each species is connected by an arc (edge) that
        has a direction, e.g., there is a direct arrow from TfR1 (transferrin receptor 1) to LIP
        (labile iron pool). In this network graph is also <i>signed</i> graph, that is, each
        connection from one species to the next is either positive (activation - blue arc with an
        arrow head) or negative (inhibition - orange arc with a hammer head).  We would like to
        note, that edges joining species do not have to be signed and our browser based
        interface <i>SteadyCellPhenotype</i> can handle any type of assignments.

      The next step in model building is to define local activation function \(f_v\) for each node in the network.
