      <h1>Ternary networks: a brief introduction</h1>

      <p class="line_space">
        Ternary models can represent biomolecular networks in a simple and intuitive manner by
        viewing the network in terms of a collection of logical rules. One can think of these models
        as an extension of Boolean models if simple logic is employed, but ternary models can also
        utilize more complicated rules and expressions. Each species in ternary network is
        represented by three states: 0, 1, and 2. Various assignments have been suggested for the
        states. For example, one possibility is to view 0 as
        <i>false/inactive</i>, 2 as <i>true/active</i>, and 1 as <i>unknown</i>, meaning that 1
        can be either true/active or false/inactive. Another possibility is to think of these
        numbers as concentration levels of various proteins: <i>low</i> (0),
        <i>normal</i> (1) and <i>high</i> (2). Regardless of the labeling, the interactions in the
        network can be translated into functions over the finite field on three elements and then
        used to perform simulations, computations of the attractors, and  visualizations of these
        attractors and trajectories.

                                            JULIA: you can adjust my wording after i finish this intro ...
                                                    Initially i just write all the ideas before deciding
                                                    what stays/goes/edits/wording/reordering ...  -->

        An example of a biological network (or a graph) is depicted in Figure 1 below.
        This network is part of our previously published much larger network
        (see
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005352"> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005352</a>).
        We have selected the <i>iron homeostasis pathway</i> to demonstrate the ideas and the terminology of
        this section. The underlying graph of this network is also a directed graph in the sense that each species
        is connected by an arc (edge) that has a direction, e.g., there is an arrow from TfR1 (transferrin receptor 1)
        to LIP (labile iron pool). In addition, in this network the graph is <i>signed</i> graph, that is, each
        connection from one species to the next is either positive (activation - blue arc with an
        arrow head) or negative (inhibition - orange arc with a hammer head).  We would like to
        note, that edges joining species do not have to be signed, but in most applications, majority of connections will
        be positive or negative.

       Formally, a ternary network is a pair \(\mathcal{T}=(G, F)\), where \(G\) is a
        digraph -->
        
        <!-- ADAM: It doesn't look like we use the digraph structure susbsequently. I understand
        that it's used as a heuristic, but should it be part of the definition?  How about defining
        a ternary network and then one suboridinate to a graph?
                
                JULIA: This page is is an intro to ternary models in general and I think we should be a bit more precise.
                I thought we wanted to have some general information about these models. Even if the app does
                not use digraphs they are part of the model building. Uninformed users should have somewhat
                detailed introduction to that... let me know now if you think that all of this is unnecessary so that
                I do not waste my time typing details. Make sure to outline for me what exactly you think should

        on \(n\) nodes and
        
        \begin{equation}
        F = (f_1, \dots, f_n): \{0,1,2\}^n \to \{0,1,2\}^n
        \end{equation}
        
        is a global transition function. Each node \(v\)
        in \(G\) takes on the values in the set \(\{0,1,2\}\) and is updated by a local activation
        function \(f_v:\{0,1,2\}^n \to \{0,1,2\}\). The value of the function \(f_v\) depends on its
        input nodes and their current state.
      </p> -->
      
      <h3> Local activation functions </h3>
      
      <p class="line_space">
      The next step in model building is to define a local activation function for each node in the network.
      The value of each local activation function depends on its input nodes (species) and their current state.
      This can be accomplished in multiple ways (i) using an analog to the Boolean formalism, (ii) tables and
      (iii) function over finite field on three elements. These are not the only possibilities. Here we describe
      the first possibility and just mention the second (our future editions will include generation of functions
      from tables directly).  As for the third option and others, our browser based interface <i> SteadyCellPhenotype</i>
      is capable of reading any input function over a finite field on three elements, thus allowing the user to explore
      any type of ternary network.
      </p>
      
      <p class="line_space">
      A local activation function for a node \(v\) is often denoted in literature by \(f_v\). If the node \(v\)
      has multiple input nodes \( w_1, w_2, \dots, w_k \), then this function is written as
      \( f_v(w_1, w_2, \dots, w_k)\). Using this notation and Figure 1 activation function, for example, for LIP
      is then \(f_{LIP}(TfR1, Fpn, Ft)\). To make notations simpler, <i>SteadyCellPhenotype</i> allows user to
      replace bulky notation \(f_{LIP}(TfR1, Fpn, Ft)\) by simply typing \(LIP.\)

      \begin{equation}
      LIP = <\text{your function goes here}>
      \end{equation}

      <p class="line_space">
      Now suppose, that a node in the network only has one input
      (e.g., IRP1 and IRP2 in Figure 1) and it is clear from the biological evidence if the regulation is positive
      or negative. In this case, one can use simple relations as depicted by the tables below.

      <h4> A node \(X\) inhibits node \(Y\): \(X \dashv Y \)</h4>

              <th>\(X\)</th>
              <th>\(f_Y(X)\)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0</td>
              <td>2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1</td>

              <td>0</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
      
     
     <p class="line_space">
      Local activation functions depicting these tables are then:
      \[
     \text{activation: } f_Y(X) = X,  \quad \text{inhibition: } f_Y(X) = 2-X
      \]
      Since \(-1 \bmod 3 = 2\), then equation for inhibition can be written as \(f_Y(X) = 2+2X\).
